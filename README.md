##  Overview

The Computational Intelligence Lab focuses on implementing and understanding the core algorithms that form the foundation of **intelligent systems**, including:
- Artificial Neural Networks  
- Fuzzy Logic Systems  
- Clustering and Unsupervised Learning  
- Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q-Learning  

Each lab assignment emphasizes both mathematical formulation and practical implementation.
